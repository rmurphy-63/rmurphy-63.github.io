## Education
- M.S., Physics | University of New Hampshire (_May 2024_)
- B.S., Physics | University of New Hampshire (_May 2022_)

## Projects
These projects showcase my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning. For projects where it is appropriate, I have attached a streamlit dashboard showing my results in an interactive format.

### Global Ecology Footprints
In this project I analyze global ecology footprint data to determine average global values for carbon footprint, cropland footprint, etc. One can also select a specific country to see their percent difference from the mean and how their ecological footprints compare to others.

### Using Machine Learning to Classify Stars
Using NASA's public dataset detailing the parameters of different stars, I tested multiple machine learning models to determine which one would best be able to correctly classify the type of the star. I tested a logistic regression model, decision tree model, and random forest model among others. I found that a Gaussian naive Bayes model worked best for the data and after tuning the hyperparameters was able to achieve a prediction accuracy of 86%.
