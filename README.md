## Projects
These projects showcase my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning. For projects where it is appropriate, I have attached a streamlit dashboard showing my results in an interactive format.

### Ecology project
Climate change and global contributions to ecological waste are a hot button topic. In this project I analyze global ecology footprint data to determine average global values for carbon footprint, cropland footprint, etc. One can also select a specific country to see their percent difference from the mean and how their ecological footprints compare to others.
